# Too Many Lists

This is my implementation for a Rust programming tutorial called [Too Many Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/index.html), where you literally write linked lists but things get more advanced as you go on.

-   [**First**](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/first.html): A Bad Singly-Linked Stack
-   [**Second**](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/second.html): An Ok Singly-Linked Stack
-   [**Third**](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/third.html): A Persistent Singly-Linked Stack
-   [**Fourth**](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/fourth.html): A Bad but Safe Doubly-Linked Deque
-   [**Fifth**](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/fifth.html): An Ok Unsafe Singly-Linked Queue
-   [**Sixth**](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/sixth.html): A Production-Quality Unsafe Doubly-Linked Deque
